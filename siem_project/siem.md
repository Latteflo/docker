# SIEM with Suricata and ELK Stack

This project implements a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Suricata and the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack. The ELK stack is highly customizable and extensible, with a large community contributing plugins and integrations. It is widely used across industries for various use cases, from IT operations to business intelligence.

## Components

- **Suricata**: Network security monitoring engine
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics engine
- **Logstash**: Data processing pipeline
- **Kibana**: Data visualization dashboard

## Configuration

- Suricata configuration: `suricata/suricata.yaml`
- Logstash pipeline: `logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf`

## Usage

1. Suricata monitors network traffic and generates alerts based on its ruleset.
2. Logstash processes these alerts and sends them to Elasticsearch.
3. Use Kibana to create visualizations and dashboards for the Suricata data.

## Customization

- Add custom Suricata rules in the `suricata/rules/` directory
- Modify the Logstash pipeline for additional log processing
- Create custom Kibana dashboards for specific monitoring needs

## Troubleshooting

- Check container logs: `docker-compose logs <service-name>`
- Ensure all services are running: `docker-compose ps`

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucene and provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine. It's schema-free and uses JSON documents. Elasticsearch can scale horizontally, handling large volumes of data by distributing operations across multiple nodes in a cluster.

Key Features:
- Near real-time operations: Data is searchable within 1 second of being indexed
- Distributed architecture: Can scale to hundreds of servers and petabytes of data
- High availability: Supports replication and failed node recovery
- RESTful API: Easy to use and language-agnostic
- Aggregations: Allows complex analytics on data

Use Cases:
1. Application search
2. Website search
3. Logging and log analysis
4. Infrastructure metrics and container monitoring
5. Business analytics
6. Geographic information systems

## Logstash

Logstash is an open-source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. It can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice.

Key Components:
- Inputs: Mechanisms to ingest data (e.g., files, syslog, beats)
- Filters: Rules to parse and transform data (e.g., grok, mutate, drop)
- Outputs: Destinations to send data (e.g., Elasticsearch, email, file)

Advanced Features:
- Codec plugins: For serializing and deserializing data
- Multi-threaded pipeline: For improved performance
- Plugin ecosystem: Extending functionality with community-developed plugins

Use Cases:
1. Log aggregation
2. Data transformation
3. Event processing
4. Data enrichment
5. Anomaly detection
6. Compliance and security

## Kibana

Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool for reviewing logs and events. It provides real-time summary and charting of streaming data, and supports various chart types.

Key Features:
- Discover: Explore your data with ad-hoc queries
- Visualize: Create and share dynamic visualizations
- Dashboard: Combine visualizations into a comprehensive view
- Canvas: Create custom dynamic infographics
- Maps: Visualize geo data
- Machine Learning: Identify anomalies in your data
- Graph: Explore relationships in your data

Advanced Capabilities:
- Spaces: Organize dashboards and visualizations
- Reporting: Generate PDF reports of your dashboards
- Alerting: Set up alerts based on your data
- Role-based access control: Manage user access to features and data

Use Cases:
1. Business intelligence
2. System monitoring
3. Security analysis
4. Customer behavior analysis
5. IoT data visualization
6. Real-time analytics

## The ELK Stack Combined

When used together, these tools provide a powerful solution for handling large volumes of data. A typical flow might look like this:

1. Logstash collects data from various sources (logs, metrics, etc.)
2. Logstash processes and transforms this data
3. The processed data is sent to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage
4. Kibana connects to Elasticsearch to provide visualization and analysis of the data

This combination is particularly powerful for use cases such as:
- Centralized logging for distributed systems
- Real-time application monitoring and performance metrics
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Business analytics and data exploration
