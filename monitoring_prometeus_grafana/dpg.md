# DPG stack

Docker, Prometheus, and Grafana is commonly referred to as the "DPG stack" or sometimes the "Docker monitoring stack."
The DPG stack name comes from the initials of its main components:

- D: Docker
- P: Prometheus
- G: Grafana

This stack is popular in the DevOps and cloud-native communities for containerized application deployment and monitoring. It provides a powerful, open-source solution for:

Containerization and orchestration (Docker)
Metrics collection and storage (Prometheus)
Data visualization and dashboarding (Grafana)


It's worth noting that this stack is often extended or modified based on specific needs. For example, some might add alerting tools or log aggregation systems to create a more comprehensive monitoring and observability solution.

## Docker and Prometheus Integration:

Docker provides the containerization layer, while Prometheus collects metrics from these containers.

- Prometheus can discover Docker containers dynamically using Docker service discovery.
- You can use the Node Exporter in a Docker container to expose host-level metrics.
- Many Docker images come with built-in Prometheus exporters, making metric collection easier.

Example Prometheus configuration for Docker:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'docker'
    docker_sd_configs:
      - host: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_docker_container_name]
        regex: '/(.*)'
        target_label: container_name
```

## Prometheus and Grafana Integration:

Prometheus acts as a data source for Grafana, which then visualizes the collected metrics.

- Grafana can query Prometheus using PromQL (Prometheus Query Language).
- You can create custom dashboards in Grafana to visualize Docker and application metrics.
- Grafana supports alerting based on Prometheus metrics.

Example Grafana dashboard query:

```
rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container_name="my-app"}[5m])
```

   ## Docker and Grafana Integration:

While Docker and Grafana don't directly interact, Docker can be used to deploy and manage Grafana.

- Grafana can be run as a Docker container, simplifying deployment and upgrades.
- Docker Compose can be used to define and run multi-container applications, including Grafana and Prometheus.

1. Full Stack Integration:

Here's an example Docker Compose file that brings all three components together:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - 9090:9090

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    depends_on:
      - prometheus
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana

  node-exporter:
    image: prom/node-exporter
    volumes:
      - /proc:/host/proc:ro
      - /sys:/host/sys:ro
      - /:/rootfs:ro
    command:
      - '--path.procfs=/host/proc'
      - '--path.sysfs=/host/sys'
      - '--collector.filesystem.ignored-mount-points=^/(sys|proc|dev|host|etc)($$|/)'

volumes:
  grafana-storage:
```

### Benefits of the DPG Stack:

1. Scalability: Docker allows for easy scaling of applications, while Prometheus can handle large amounts of time-series data.

2. Flexibility: Each component can be replaced or upgraded independently.

3. Comprehensive Monitoring: From container-level to application-level metrics, the stack provides deep insights.

4. Alerting: Prometheus and Grafana both offer alerting capabilities for proactive monitoring.

5. Visualization: Grafana provides powerful, customizable dashboards for data visualization.

6. Open Source: All components are open-source, reducing costs and allowing for community-driven improvements.

#### Advanced Topics:

1. Service Discovery: Prometheus can automatically discover and monitor new containers as they're created.

2. Custom Exporters: You can create custom Prometheus exporters for your applications to expose business-specific metrics.

3. High Availability: Both Prometheus and Grafana can be set up in high-availability configurations for increased reliability.

4. Alertmanager: Prometheus's Alertmanager can be integrated for more advanced alert routing, grouping, and deduplication.
